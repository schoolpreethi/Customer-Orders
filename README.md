# Customer-Orders

I just completed a mini project where I analyzed an e-commerce dataset using SQL to uncover valuable business insights from customer orders!

🎯 Project Objective:
To explore customer purchasing behavior, identify top-performing products, track revenue trends, and detect inactive customers to support re-engagement strategies.

🛠️ Key Tasks & SQL Concepts Used:

✅ Viewed all orders and product lists using SELECT & DISTINCT.

📦 Identified Top 5 best-selling products using GROUP BY, SUM(), and ORDER BY.

📈 Tracked customer satisfaction using AVG(Rating).

📅 Analyzed time-based trends using WHERE with DATE conditions.

💡 Key Insights:

Identified high-revenue products for marketing focus.

Segmented customers based on order history.

Flagged inactive users for potential reactivation.

Calculated average ratings to monitor satisfaction.

conclusion:
This project helped me sharpen my SQL skills and understand how structured queries can answer real business questions. I’m excited to apply these skills in a professional environment.
